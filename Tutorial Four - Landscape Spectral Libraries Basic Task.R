#In the last basic exercise, you were given the steps to process the PSR+3500 data.
#In this basic task, the ASD FieldSpec4 data will be used for data processing.
#Generate a tibble of the corrected ASD data, found in Tutorial Four Data
#Group the data by "landscape" type (BES_gravel, BES_sand, BES_soil, and BES_heather), then plot with ggplot2
#Use the SRT_09_20250406.csv as the reflectance calibration file.

#Conduct an NDVI analysis of your data.
#Remember to initiate an empty tibble
#What landscape class would you expect to see the highest values of NDVI?
